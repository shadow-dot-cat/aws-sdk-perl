=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $codepipeline = Paws->service('CodePipeline');
    $codepipeline->PutThirdPartyJobSuccessResult(
      ClientToken       => 'MyClientToken',
      JobId             => 'MyThirdPartyJobId',
      ContinuationToken => 'MyContinuationToken',    # OPTIONAL
      CurrentRevision   => {
        ChangeIdentifier => 'MyRevisionChangeIdentifier',    # min: 1, max: 100
        Revision         => 'MyRevision',                    # min: 1, max: 1500
        Created          => '1970-01-01T01:00:00',           # OPTIONAL
        RevisionSummary => 'MyRevisionSummary',    # min: 1, max: 2048; OPTIONAL
      },    # OPTIONAL
      ExecutionDetails => {
        ExternalExecutionId => 'MyExecutionId',    # min: 1, max: 1500; OPTIONAL
        PercentComplete     => 1,                  # max: 100; OPTIONAL

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ClientToken => Str

The clientToken portion of the clientId and clientToken pair used to
verify that the calling entity is allowed access to the job and its
details.



=head2 ContinuationToken => Str

A token generated by a job worker, such as an AWS CodeDeploy deployment
ID, that a successful job provides to identify a partner action in
progress. Future jobs will use this token in order to identify the
running instance of the action. It can be reused to return additional
information about the progress of the partner action. When the action
is complete, no continuation token should be supplied.



=head2 CurrentRevision => L<Paws::CodePipeline::CurrentRevision>

Represents information about a current revision.



=head2 ExecutionDetails => L<Paws::CodePipeline::ExecutionDetails>

The details of the actions taken and results produced on an artifact as
it passes through stages in the pipeline.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> JobId => Str

The ID of the job that successfully completed. This is the same ID
returned from PollForThirdPartyJobs.
