=head1 NAME

Paws::Organizations::ListHandshakesForOrganization - Arguments for method ListHandshakesForOrganization on L<Paws::Organizations>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method ListHandshakesForOrganization on the
L<AWS Organizations|Paws::Organizations> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method ListHandshakesForOrganization.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to ListHandshakesForOrganization.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $organizations = Paws->service('Organizations');
    my $ListHandshakesForOrganizationResponse =
      $organizations->ListHandshakesForOrganization(
      Filter => {
        ActionType => 'INVITE'
        , # values: INVITE, ENABLE_ALL_FEATURES, APPROVE_ALL_FEATURES, ADD_ORGANIZATIONS_SERVICE_LINKED_ROLE; OPTIONAL
        ParentHandshakeId => 'MyHandshakeId',    # OPTIONAL
      },    # OPTIONAL
      MaxResults => 1,                # OPTIONAL
      NextToken  => 'MyNextToken',    # OPTIONAL
      );

    # Results:
    my $Handshakes = $ListHandshakesForOrganizationResponse->Handshakes;
    my $NextToken  = $ListHandshakesForOrganizationResponse->NextToken;

# Returns a L<Paws::Organizations::ListHandshakesForOrganizationResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/organizations/ListHandshakesForOrganization>

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Filter => L<Paws::Organizations::HandshakeFilter>

A filter of the handshakes that you want included in the response. The
default is all types. Use the C<ActionType> element to limit the output
to only a specified type, such as C<INVITE>, C<ENABLE-ALL-FEATURES>, or
C<APPROVE-ALL-FEATURES>. Alternatively, for the C<ENABLE-ALL-FEATURES>
handshake that generates a separate child handshake for each member
account, you can specify the C<ParentHandshakeId> to see only the
handshakes that were generated by that parent request.



=head2 MaxResults => Int

(Optional) Use this to limit the number of results you want included
per page in the response. If you do not include this parameter, it
defaults to a value that is specific to the operation. If additional
items exist beyond the maximum you specify, the C<NextToken> response
element is present and has a value (is not null). Include that value as
the C<NextToken> request parameter in the next call to the operation to
get the next part of the results. Note that Organizations might return
fewer results than the maximum even when there are more results
available. You should check C<NextToken> after every operation to
ensure that you receive all of the results.



=head2 NextToken => Str

Use this parameter if you receive a C<NextToken> response in a previous
request that indicates that there is more output available. Set it to
the value of the previous call's C<NextToken> response to indicate
where the output should continue from.
