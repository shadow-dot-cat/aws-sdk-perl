=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method DeleteUser on the
L<AWS Identity and Access Management|Paws::IAM> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method DeleteUser.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to DeleteUser.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # To delete an IAM user
    # The following command removes the IAM user named Bob from the current
    # account.
    $iam->DeleteUser(
      {
        'UserName' => 'Bob'
      }
    );


Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
