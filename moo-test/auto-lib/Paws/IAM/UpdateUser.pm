=head1 NAME

Paws::IAM::UpdateUser - Arguments for method UpdateUser on L<Paws::IAM>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method UpdateUser on the
L<AWS Identity and Access Management|Paws::IAM> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method UpdateUser.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to UpdateUser.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $iam = Paws->service('IAM');
    # To change an IAM user's name
    # The following command changes the name of the IAM user Bob to Robert. It
    # does not change the user's path.
    $iam->UpdateUser(
      {
        'NewUserName' => 'Robert',
        'UserName'    => 'Bob'
      }
    );


Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/iam/UpdateUser>
