=head1 NAME

Paws::Neptune::RebootDBInstance - Arguments for method RebootDBInstance on L<Paws::Neptune>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method RebootDBInstance on the
L<Amazon Neptune|Paws::Neptune> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method RebootDBInstance.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to RebootDBInstance.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $rds = Paws->service('Neptune');
    my $RebootDBInstanceResult = $rds->RebootDBInstance(
      DBInstanceIdentifier => 'MyString',
      ForceFailover        => 1,            # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $DBInstance = $RebootDBInstanceResult->DBInstance;

    # Returns a L<Paws::Neptune::RebootDBInstanceResult> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/rds/RebootDBInstance>
