=head1 NAME

Paws::ECS::ListContainerInstances - Arguments for method ListContainerInstances on L<Paws::ECS>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method ListContainerInstances on the
L<Amazon EC2 Container Service|Paws::ECS> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method ListContainerInstances.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to ListContainerInstances.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $ecs = Paws->service('ECS');
    # To list your available container instances in a cluster
    # This example lists all of your available container instances in the
    # specified cluster in your default region.
    my $ListContainerInstancesResponse = $ecs->ListContainerInstances(
      {
        'Cluster' => 'default'
      }
    );

    # Results:
    my $containerInstanceArns =
      $ListContainerInstancesResponse->containerInstanceArns;

    # Returns a L<Paws::ECS::ListContainerInstancesResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/ecs/ListContainerInstances>

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Cluster => Str

The short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the cluster that
hosts the container instances to list. If you do not specify a cluster,
the default cluster is assumed.



=head2 Filter => Str

You can filter the results of a C<ListContainerInstances> operation
with cluster query language statements. For more information, see
Cluster Query Language
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/cluster-query-language.html)
in the I<Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide>.



=head2 MaxResults => Int

The maximum number of container instance results returned by
C<ListContainerInstances> in paginated output. When this parameter is
used, C<ListContainerInstances> only returns C<maxResults> results in a
single page along with a C<nextToken> response element. The remaining
results of the initial request can be seen by sending another
C<ListContainerInstances> request with the returned C<nextToken> value.
This value can be between 1 and 100. If this parameter is not used,
then C<ListContainerInstances> returns up to 100 results and a
C<nextToken> value if applicable.



=head2 NextToken => Str

The C<nextToken> value returned from a previous paginated
C<ListContainerInstances> request where C<maxResults> was used and the
results exceeded the value of that parameter. Pagination continues from
the end of the previous results that returned the C<nextToken> value.

This token should be treated as an opaque identifier that is only used
to retrieve the next items in a list and not for other programmatic
purposes.



=head2 Status => Str

Filters the container instances by status. For example, if you specify
the C<DRAINING> status, the results include only container instances
that have been set to C<DRAINING> using UpdateContainerInstancesState.
If you do not specify this parameter, the default is to include
container instances set to C<ACTIVE> and C<DRAINING>.

Valid values are: C<"ACTIVE">, C<"DRAINING">
