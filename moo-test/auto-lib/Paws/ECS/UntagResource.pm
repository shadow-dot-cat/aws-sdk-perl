=head1 NAME

Paws::ECS::UntagResource - Arguments for method UntagResource on L<Paws::ECS>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method UntagResource on the
L<Amazon EC2 Container Service|Paws::ECS> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method UntagResource.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to UntagResource.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $ecs = Paws->service('ECS');
    my $UntagResourceResponse = $ecs->UntagResource(
      ResourceArn => 'MyString',
      TagKeys     => [
        'MyTagKey', ...    # min: 1, max: 128
      ],

    );

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/ecs/UntagResource>
