=head1 NAME

Paws::KinesisAnalyticsV2::DeleteApplicationOutput - Arguments for method DeleteApplicationOutput on L<Paws::KinesisAnalyticsV2>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method DeleteApplicationOutput on the
L<Amazon Kinesis Analytics|Paws::KinesisAnalyticsV2> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method DeleteApplicationOutput.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to DeleteApplicationOutput.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $kinesisanalytics = Paws->service('KinesisAnalyticsV2');
    my $DeleteApplicationOutputResponse =
      $kinesisanalytics->DeleteApplicationOutput(
      ApplicationName             => 'MyApplicationName',
      CurrentApplicationVersionId => 1,
      OutputId                    => 'MyId',

      );

    # Results:
    my $ApplicationARN = $DeleteApplicationOutputResponse->ApplicationARN;
    my $ApplicationVersionId =
      $DeleteApplicationOutputResponse->ApplicationVersionId;

# Returns a L<Paws::KinesisAnalyticsV2::DeleteApplicationOutputResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ApplicationName => Str

The application name.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> CurrentApplicationVersionId => Int

The application version. You can use the DescribeApplication operation
to get the current application version. If the version specified is not
the current version, the C<ConcurrentModificationException> is
returned.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> OutputId => Str

The ID of the configuration to delete. Each output configuration that
is added to the application (either when the application is created or
later) using the AddApplicationOutput operation has a unique ID. You
need to provide the ID to uniquely identify the output configuration
that you want to delete from the application configuration. You can use
the DescribeApplication operation to get the specific C<OutputId>.
