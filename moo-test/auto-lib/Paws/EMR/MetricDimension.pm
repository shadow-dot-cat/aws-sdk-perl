Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::EMR::MetricDimension object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Key => $value, ..., Value => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::EMR::MetricDimension object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Key

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A CloudWatch dimension, which is specified using a C<Key> (known as a
C<Name> in CloudWatch), C<Value> pair. By default, Amazon EMR uses one
dimension whose C<Key> is C<JobFlowID> and C<Value> is a variable
representing the cluster ID, which is C<${emr.clusterId}>. This enables
the rule to bootstrap when the cluster ID becomes available.
