=head1 NAME

Paws::Glacier::AbortMultipartUpload - Arguments for method AbortMultipartUpload on L<Paws::Glacier>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method AbortMultipartUpload on the
L<Amazon Glacier|Paws::Glacier> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method AbortMultipartUpload.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to AbortMultipartUpload.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $glacier = Paws->service('Glacier');
    # To abort a multipart upload identified by the upload ID
    # The example deletes an in-progress multipart upload to a vault named
    # my-vault:
    $glacier->AbortMultipartUpload(
      {
        'AccountId' => '-',
        'UploadId' =>
'19gaRezEXAMPLES6Ry5YYdqthHOC_kGRCT03L9yetr220UmPtBYKk-OssZtLqyFu7sY1_lR7vgFuJV6NtcV5zpsJ',
        'VaultName' => 'my-vault'
      }
    );


Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/glacier/AbortMultipartUpload>

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> AccountId => Str

The C<AccountId> value is the AWS account ID of the account that owns
the vault. You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally a
single 'C<->' (hyphen), in which case Amazon Glacier uses the AWS
account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request. If
you use an account ID, do not include any hyphens ('-') in the ID.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> UploadId => Str

The upload ID of the multipart upload to delete.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> VaultName => Str

The name of the vault.
