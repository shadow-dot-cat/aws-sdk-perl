=head1 NAME

Paws::ElastiCache::ReservedCacheNode

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ElastiCache::ReservedCacheNode object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CacheNodeCount => $value, ..., UsagePrice => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ElastiCache::ReservedCacheNode object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CacheNodeCount

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Represents the output of a C<PurchaseReservedCacheNodesOffering>
operation.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CacheNodeCount => Int

  The number of cache nodes that have been reserved.


=head2 CacheNodeType => Str

  The cache node type for the reserved cache nodes.

The following node types are supported by ElastiCache. Generally
speaking, the current generation types provide more memory and
computational power at lower cost when compared to their equivalent
previous generation counterparts.
