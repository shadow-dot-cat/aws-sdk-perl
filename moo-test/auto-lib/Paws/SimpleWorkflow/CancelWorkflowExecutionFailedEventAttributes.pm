=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Cause => Str

  The cause of the failure. This information is generated by the system
and can be useful for diagnostic purposes.

If C<cause> is set to C<OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED>, the decision failed
because it lacked sufficient permissions. For details and example IAM
policies, see Using IAM to Manage Access to Amazon SWF Workflows
(http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/swf-dev-iam.html)
in the I<Amazon SWF Developer Guide>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> DecisionTaskCompletedEventId => Int

  The ID of the C<DecisionTaskCompleted> event corresponding to the
decision task that resulted in the C<CancelWorkflowExecution> decision
for this cancellation request. This information can be useful for
diagnosing problems by tracing back the chain of events leading up to
this event.
