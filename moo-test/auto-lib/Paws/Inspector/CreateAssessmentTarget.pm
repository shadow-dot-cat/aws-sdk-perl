Paws::Inspector::CreateAssessmentTarget - Arguments for method CreateAssessmentTarget on L<Paws::Inspector>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method CreateAssessmentTarget on the
L<Amazon Inspector|Paws::Inspector> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method CreateAssessmentTarget.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to CreateAssessmentTarget.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $inspector = Paws->service('Inspector');
   # Create assessment target
   # Creates a new assessment target using the ARN of the resource group that is
   # generated by CreateResourceGroup. You can create up to 50 assessment
   # targets per AWS account. You can run up to 500 concurrent agents per AWS
   # account.
    my $CreateAssessmentTargetResponse = $inspector->CreateAssessmentTarget(
      {
        'AssessmentTargetName' => 'ExampleAssessmentTarget',
        'ResourceGroupArn' =>
          'arn:aws:inspector:us-west-2:123456789012:resourcegroup/0-AB6DMKnv'
      }
    );

    # Results:
    my $assessmentTargetArn =
      $CreateAssessmentTargetResponse->assessmentTargetArn;

    # Returns a L<Paws::Inspector::CreateAssessmentTargetResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
