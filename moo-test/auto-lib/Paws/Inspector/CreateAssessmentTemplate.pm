=head1 NAME

Paws::Inspector::CreateAssessmentTemplate - Arguments for method CreateAssessmentTemplate on L<Paws::Inspector>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method CreateAssessmentTemplate on the
L<Amazon Inspector|Paws::Inspector> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method CreateAssessmentTemplate.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to CreateAssessmentTemplate.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $inspector = Paws->service('Inspector');
    # Create assessment template
    # Creates an assessment template for the assessment target that is specified
    # by the ARN of the assessment target.
    my $CreateAssessmentTemplateResponse = $inspector->CreateAssessmentTemplate(
      {
        'AssessmentTargetArn' =>
          'arn:aws:inspector:us-west-2:123456789012:target/0-nvgVhaxX',
        'AssessmentTemplateName' => 'ExampleAssessmentTemplate',
        'DurationInSeconds'      => 180,
        'RulesPackageArns' =>
          ['arn:aws:inspector:us-west-2:758058086616:rulespackage/0-11B9DBXp'],
        'UserAttributesForFindings' => [

          {
            'Key'   => 'Example',
            'Value' => 'example'
          }
        ]
      }
    );

    # Results:
    my $assessmentTemplateArn =
      $CreateAssessmentTemplateResponse->assessmentTemplateArn;

    # Returns a L<Paws::Inspector::CreateAssessmentTemplateResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
